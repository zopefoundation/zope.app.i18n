4.0.1 (2019-07-10)
------------------

- Add support for Python 3.7.

  locations in zope.interface.interfaces.

------------------

- The synchronization view now uses Python's built-in transport for

  does not permit a colon (``:``) in the username, but does allow colons
  in the password (if the server properly conforms to the specification).

     into ``zope.publisher`` and will only apply if ``zope.annotation`` is
     available.
   * The IUserPreferredCharsets adapter registration was also moved into

- Depend on zope.component >= 3.6 instead of zope.app.component as the
